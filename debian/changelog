ros-groovy-designator-integration-msgs (0.0.1-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Cleaned up CMakeLists.txt
  * Added package descriptions and fixed licenses where applicable
  * Added new types into message definition
  * Removed faulty feedback entry in the ROS service
  * Some more clean up of catkin make related files: message generation explicitly invokes all possible languages.
  * fixed CMakeLists.txt and package.xml dependencies.
  * Changed the `value_data' field to a much more meaningful char array rather than a float32 array
  * Added type `geometry_msgs::Pose'
  * Abstracted the type of requests and responses for deginator services
  * Added message types for communication via designators
  * Contributors: Jan Winkler, Jan-Hendrik Worch, Wiedemeyer
